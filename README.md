# book-price-retrieval
A command line program using Distributed Systems and Networking concepts demonstrating the connection between a server and client to retrieve book price information based on the entered book ISBN code. This program was developed using Scala.

To set up the project:
1. First create a terminal at this directory, and run "sbt run" and then enter 1 to start the server.
2. After that, create another terminal at this directory, and run "sbt run" and then enter 2 to start the client.
3. Next, you can follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the rest of the program. Enter an ISBN value found in the book.csv file, to see the program returning the price for that corresponding book.
